# The Landing Page project from the front-end web professional track.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. my rule is to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. By modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily and mainly the JavaScript file.
