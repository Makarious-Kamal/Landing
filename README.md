# The Landing Page project from the front-end web professional track.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. my rule is to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. By modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily and mainly the JavaScript file.

some of the project main functionalities are:
* Building a dynamic navigation bar which changes automatically based on the number of the landing page sections.
* Setting class active state when the element is in the viewport and styling added for active states.
* Adding a scrolling to top button.
* Hiding the navbar by setting timeout function.
